OVERVIEW

The Bezel Project Bezel Utility menu.

This utility will provide a downloader for Retroarach system bezel packs to be used for various systems within RetroPie.

This utility provides a download for a bezel pack for a system and includes a PNG bezel file for every ROM for that system.  The download will also include the necessary configuration files needed for Retroarch to show them.  The script will also update the required retroarch.cfg files for the emulators located in the /opt/retropie/configs directory.  These changes are necessary to show the PNG bezels with an opacity of 1.

Periodically, new bezel packs are completed and you will need to run the script updater to download the newest version to see these additional packs.

The instructions below will demonstrate how to instal the script and have it show up in the RetroPie menu within Emulation Station.

***NOTE***
To have global support, these bezel packs will only work if the ROMs you are using are named according to the No-Intro naming convention used by EmuMovies/HyperSpin.

Systems with shared Retroarch cores and filenames: 
Only one bezel can exist for a specific game name, so systems that share the same Retroarch core and rom filename will use the same bezel.

-------
INSTALLATION - using a Raspberry Pi build of RetroPie

NOTE: do not install the script as user 'root'.  Only install the script as user 'pi'...otherwise it may cause future errors.

Exit out of Emulation Station by pressing F4 (or remote into the Pi using something like Putty)

Type the following commands:

***cd /home/pi/RetroPie/retropiemenu/*** 

***wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebezelproject/BezelProject/master/bezelproject.sh***

***chmod +x "bezelproject.sh"***

Restart Emulation Station and you should then see the new script in the RetroPie menu.

-------
UNINSTALL

NOTE: the uninstall script will not remove the Retroarch game config files due to the possibility of user's saving game specific override controller mapping. This will, however, delete all bezel usage from The Bezel Project but keeps any existing game override controller mapping.

To automatically remove The Bezel Project, execute that option in the script.

To manually remove The Bezel Project, delete the following directories.

/opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch/overlay/ArcadeBezels

/opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch/overlay/GameBezels

Edit the retroarch.cfg files located in each emulator's folder located here:

/opt/retropie/configs/(emulatorname)

And remove the following lines from the file that begin with the following:

input_overlay = xxxxxx 

input_overlay_opacity = xxxxx

To remove the Retroarch game override config files, delete the core named folders located here:

/opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch/config/(core named folder)

Remove the bezelproject.sh file from here:

/home/pi/RetroPie/retropiemenu/
